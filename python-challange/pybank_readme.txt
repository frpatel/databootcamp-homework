Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. Financial data is in [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). 
The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

Developed Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Analysis look similar to the one below:
